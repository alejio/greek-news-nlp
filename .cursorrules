# PROJECT OVERVIEW

- This project aims to create a web application that shows the bias of Greek sports journalists relating to specific topics, club owners, matches, referees, etc.
- The data sources are journalist articles from major Greek sports websites such as https://www.sport24.gr/, https://www.sdna.gr, https://www.gazzetta.gr. Additional data sources should include football match details such as results, major refereeing decisions such as red cards and penalties, etc. Data are scraped from the websites and stored in a PostgreSQL database. 
- The web application will allow users to search for articles, topics, clubs, matches, referees, etc. and will show the bias of the journalists in the articles. It should also allow comparisons between different journalists, topics, clubs, matches, referees, etc.
- The web application should be user friendly and aesthetically pleasing.
